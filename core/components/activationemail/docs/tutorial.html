<h3>Installation</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Go to System | Package Management</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Download Extras&quot; button</li>
    <li>Type &quot;ActivationEmail&quot; in the search box and press
        Enter.</li>
    <li>Click on the download button next to the Activation Email
        package</li>
    <li>Wait until the download button changes to &quot;downloaded&quot;</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Finish&quot;, button</li>
    <li>You should see the ActivationEmail package in the grid</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;install&quot; button next to the
        package</li>
    <li>Click on &quot;OK&quot; to close the console</li>
    <li>Check to make sure that the plugin and the two chunks were
        installed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Checking the Install</h3>
<p>The first thing to do is to make sure the plugin is installed
    properly. Create a new user with your email address. Activate and
    deactivate the user a few times and see if you get an email
    message. If you don't, make sure your email system is working by
    downloading and installing the QuickEmail snippet.</p>

<p>The deactivation email is off by default so you won't get it unless
    you change the sendOnDeactivation property of the plugin to True.
    If you won't be using that feature, don't bother.</p>

<p>Once the email is arriving. The odds are that you will want to
    modify one or both of the Tpl chunks containing the message forms
    (if not, you're done -- sit back and relax). In order to keep the
    Tpl chunks from being overwritten by upgrades, duplicate and
    rename them.
<h3>Duplicating and Renaming the Chunks</h3>
<ul>
    <li>On the left side of the screen, click on the Elements tab</li>
    <li>Right-click on the ActivationEmailTpl chunk in the chunk
        section of the Elements tree and select "Duplicate Chunk"</li>
    <li>Call the new chunk &quot;MyActivationEmailTpl&quot;</li>
    <li>If you will be sending a deactivation email, do the same thing
        for the DeactivationEmailTpl</li>
    <li>Don't change the content of the new chunk(s) yet</li>
</ul>
<h3>Creating the Property Set</h3>

<p>Like the Tpl chunk(s), you don't want the properties to be
    overwritten during an upgrade, so you should create a property set
    for your own settings.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Edit the plugin and click on the &quot;Properties&quot;
        tab</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Add Property Set&quot; button</li>
    <li>Check the &quot;Crete New Property Set&quot; checkbox</li>
    <li>Use the name MyActivationEmailProperties; add a description if
        you like</li>
    <li>Highlight the name and save it to the clipboard</li>
    <li>Click on the &quot;Save&quot; button</li>
    <li>In the &quot;Value&quot; column, double-click on
        ActivationEmailTpl (or right-click and update it)</li>
    <li>Paste in the name from the clipboard (or type in
        MyActivationEmailTpl)</li>
    <li>Do the same for the DeactivationEmailTpl if you'll be using
        that</li>
    <li>Important: Click on the &quot;Save Property Set&quot; button
    </li>

</ul>
<h3>Connecting the Property Set</h3>

<p>Now we need to tell MODx to use our own property set with the
    plugin</p>
<ul>
    <li>Still editing the plugin, click on the System Events tab</li>
    <li>Scroll down to the OnUserBeforeSave event (note: Not
        OnBeforeUserFormSave)</li>
    <li> You may have to look on multiple pages to find it</li>
    <li>Make sure it has the checkbox checked</li>
    <li>Double-click in the Property Set column (column 4)</li>
    <li>Using the drop-down list, select the
        MyActivationEmailProperties set</li>
    <li>Important: Click on the &quot;Save&quot; button to save the
        plugin</li>
</ul>

<h3>Retesting and Configuring</h3>

<p>Activate and deactivate your user a few times. Make sure the emails
    are still arriving
    and that the messages are correct.<p>

<p>Edit the plugin and click on the &quot;Properties&quot; tab. Make
    sure you are editing
    your own property set, not the default properties, by selecting
    MyActivationEmailProperties
    in the drop-down list at the upper left of the grid. You can see
    what each property does
    by clicking on the little plus sign next to it in the grid. Set
    the properties to meet your
    needs. Be sure not to edit anything
    except the &quot;Value&quot; column.</p>

<p>When you're finished click on the &quot;Save Property
    Set&quot; button. Notice that any properties you change show
    up in green once you save the set. That shows that they have
    different values than the default properties</p>

<p>You may have to clear the site cache to before your changes take
    effect.</p>

<h3>Customizing the Tpl Chunks</h3>

<p>The two Tpl chunks can be completely rewritten to meet your needs.
    Be sure to edit the two duplicate Tpl chunks, not the ones that
    were
    installed with the Activation Email package.
    Be sure to include the [<!-- -->[<!-- -->+username]<!-- -->]
    placeholder so the user will be
    addressed by name.</p>

<p> The other placeholders are optional. All will
    be set to appropriate system settings,
    but you can set their values in the property set you created. You
    can also modify them or remove them if you wish. Since you've
    renamed the Tpl chunks, your changes will
    survive any upgrades.

<p>Note that the [<!-- -->[<!-- -->+username]<!-- -->] placeholder
    should
    not change, even if you use the &amp;useFullname property.</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>The following properties control the behavior
    of the ActivationEmail plugin. If you need to alter any of them
    be sure to create a property set and specify it on the System
    Events
    tab as described above. When changing the property values,
    always be sure that you're modifying your property set and
    not the default properties. The default properties are locked
    to remind you to do so.</p>
